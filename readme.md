# Good Reads Book Recommender web app
A simple web-scrapping app built in Python and JavaScript.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to dive deeper into web scrapping and sending emails using SMTP. The idea is building a simple monthly recommendation mailing list. It recommends books based on the userâ€™s Good Reads library. It simply picks out the top rated books by the user (or the genral rating if not rated) and uses them to get recommendations which are brought from https://www.whatshouldireadnext.com/.  The idea was inspired by my desire to have a monthly recommendation list based on my library.
